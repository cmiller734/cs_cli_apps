#### CS Code Samples

This C# project requires the .NET Core SDK to be installed on your computer. The simplest way to run the project is to run the command 'dotnet run'. This will print the output of all 3 CS files
in the terminal.

If the command is not working, see this article on the command: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run?tabs=netcore2x

Alternatively, you can compile and run the app as you would a standard .NET application.
